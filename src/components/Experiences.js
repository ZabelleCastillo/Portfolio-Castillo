                                      <strong>Job responsibilities: </strong> As a Software Engineer Associate, my job responsibilities encompass both back-end and front-end development across multiple platforms. 
                                      From August 2024 to August 2025, I worked extensively with Boomi for API integration. Initially, our main goal was to migrate data from TIBCO to Boomi, ensuring 
                                      seamless transition and minimal disruption to business operations. My responsibilities included designing and implementing end-to-end integration solutions using 
                                      the Boomi platform, developing workflows, connectors, and APIs to ensure smooth data exchange between systems. I tested integrations to verify alignment with business 
                                      requirements, debugged and troubleshooted issues to optimize performance, and collaborated with cross-functional teams—including business analysts and solution architects—to 
                                      provide effective integration solutions. Additionally, I maintained technical documentation for integration processes, configuration settings, and customizations, and provided 
                                      ongoing support and maintenance for deployed integrations, implementing updates and improvements as needed.

                                      Since the second week of August 2025, I have been contributing to a new project using AngularJS and NodeJS, handling both front-end and back-end 
                                      development. In this project, I work on building and maintaining a platform that leverages AI to assist users in querying and understanding their needs, 
                                      ensuring a responsive and intelligent user experience. My responsibilities include designing and implementing front-end components, developing server-side logic, 
                                      integrating APIs, and maintaining smooth communication between client-side and server-side systems. I also collaborate closely with cross-functional teams to translate
                                       business requirements into technical solutions, troubleshoot issues, optimize performance, and maintain documentation for future reference.
